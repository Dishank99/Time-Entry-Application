# Time Entry Application
This the Time Logging Application built as an Asignment of one of my Interview rounds.
This Application has the feature of Logging time for the Tasks.

A User can add Task for his/her project.
Once added, user can start the time inorder to track the time taken.
A user can see the time spend for a particular task by the stop watch provided.
And once the user ends the task the he/she can the the total time taken by him/her to complete the task

Note: Feature of adding the project is not implemented as it was ot asked as part of the assignment.
The project for a particular user can be aaded through admin panel by creating new superuser
